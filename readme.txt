This plugin enables you to upload images for nav menu items on a menu edit screen. By default, those images will be displayed instead of text for respective menu items. Note that after upload, you should set an image as 'featured' to be able to display it.

Developers can make their own way of displaying images by setting `nmi_filter_menu_item_content` filter to `false`, or by filtering output generated by plugin.

Although this plugin displays uploaded images out of the box, it will probably not give best possible look, so it's recommended to create custom CSS styles for affected elements.

Nav Menu Images code is partially based on a code from now defunct plugin Custom Menu Images by [Anabelle Handdoek
](http://huellaspyp.com/)/[âˆžmanos s.a.s](http://8manos.com/) and a code from plugin [Metronet Profile Picture](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/metronet-profile-picture/) by [Ronald Huereca](http://www.ronalfy.com/)/[Metronet Norge AS](http://www.metronet.no/).
